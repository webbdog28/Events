#OpenShift CLI
##1.	Easy Method
There is a jump server that has provisioned that you can SSH into that has all of the tools you’ll need to complete the labs. The information should be contained in the email you received after you registered and should looks something like this:
OC Jump VM	ocvm.westus.cloudapp.azure.com

 
##2.	Involved Method
OpenShift Client Tools Site 1 installation Site 2, Red Hat download

Step 2 For Linux and OSX users, decompress the zip file and copy the binary to the /usr/local/bin directory, or one of the paths listed in the PATH environment variable
For Windows users, go to http://git-scm.com/download/win to download git bash for Windows (during installation you need to specify in the selection to integrate with the command prompt).

##CLI basic configuration
The easiest way to initially setup the OpenShift CLI is to use the oc login command. It’ll interactively ask you a server URL, username and password. The information is automatically saved in a CLI configuration file that is then used for subsequent commands.
To login to a remote server use:
$ oc login https://master.ocp.cloudvillage.in:8443/
